# A Structural Analysis of Academic Writing 

In this project I analyze abstracts and introductions from the journal [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/) using [Llama 3.2](https://www.llama.com). A expository blog post on this project can be found on my website [rwheadon.dev](https://rwheadon.dev). The `data` directory contains the datasets created in this project:
- `plos-cb.json` contains the abstracts and introductions from all 9,653 papers published in PLOS Computational Biology since the journal's inception in 2005. 
- `plos-cb-categorized.json` contains the raw JSON generated by the LLM. 
- `plos-cb-tidy.csv` contains the formatted sentence categorization data.

This repository also contains the various scripts I used for the project:
- `scraper.py` fully web scrapes the PLOS Computational Biology journal. The code could be easily adapted to scrape a different PLOS journal.
- `categorizer.py` makes calls to the [Groq](https://groq.com/) API to do sentence categorization. It requires the user to save an API key in the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `analysis.R` does the data wrangling and visualization using the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

The idea for this project came from my supervisor, [Prof. Eric Cytrynbaum](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cytryn/index.shtml).
